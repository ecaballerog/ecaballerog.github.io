Hello! This is Enrique Caballero, doctoral student at the University of Klagenfurt interested in UAV technologies. I work on novel techniques for implementing Drones in Cellular Networks. I hold a Master's degree in Aeronautical Engineering and a Bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering. Before joining the University of Klagenfurt, I worked as a Systems Engineer in UAV companies and space companies, developing systems with a V&V approach. My entrepreneurial spirit and start-up experience led him to start his own business, developing IoT projects.
